      <h1>Hi everyone. Sorry I have to leave early for personal reasons. I will try to tune in on zoom if I can. Xiaohu Laoshi will take care of you during the livecode - let's give him a big round of applause(you have to actually do it!)</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">For today's livecode, we are going to make this cool <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4373583-Product-Card" target="_blank">product card</a>ðŸ•º. You have some basic css configuration to start with. Take a look in the css folder - there are some classes that you can already use.</p>

      <h1>Pseudo-code:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Draw the html structure on the whiteboard, write down <strong>meaningful</strong> and <strong>consistent</strong> class names</li>
        <li>Code the html structure & content <strong>without worrying about the style</strong>!!</li>
        <li>Style it with css. If it's hard to see the div structure, you can add (ugly) background-color to the divs, so you see where they are.</li>
      </ol>
